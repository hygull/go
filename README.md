# go (go-of-google-resources)
This repository contains the Go source files, some text files &amp; images related to the important aspects of Go. These images will be helpful for setting up the Go workspace in your MAC-OS-X. This repository uses go version go1.7 darwin/amd64.

# go-workspace
This is the GoWorkspace folder. I don't wanted to include this directory here but later I thought that this workspace directory structure will be very helpful for the Go beginners in setting up their GoWorkspace.

If you want to setup this workspace as your GoWorkspace then you need to clone this project and after that you need to set your GOPATH so that it points to go-workspace directory.
